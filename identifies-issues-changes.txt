1. Issue related to performance

fetchUsers function triggers every time, searchTerm changes, but actual api does not depend on the searchTerm, this leads to unnessary api call requests

 we need to optimize the useEffect to ensure data fetch occurs only when needed

2. no error handling for API calls 

so if api fails or returns invalid response, component will crash or behave unexpectadly

we need to add proper try catch blocks to handle error state accordingly.

3. to improve security, remove dangerouslysetInnerHtml, with safer content rendering

4. memory management - need to clean up Webssocket connection
modify the websocket connection to clean up when component is unmounted
